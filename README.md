# Acetylcholinesterase-Proteomics-Analysis
This analysis is conducted on a dataset containing protein sequences derived from Acetylcholinesterase. The provided Python script, acetylcholinesterase_analysis.py, utilizes the Biopython library to perform a preliminary analysis.

# Introduction
This project focuses on the proteomic analysis of the protein Acetylcholinesterase. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) is an essential enzyme in the nervous system, responsible for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine, terminating the signal transmission at cholinergic synapses.

# Usage
## Prerequisites:

- Python installed on your system (Download Python).
- Biopython library (pip install biopython).


## Prepare FASTA File:

Place your Acetylcholinesterase protein sequences in a FASTA file named acetylcholinesterase_sequences.fasta.

## Execute the Analysis:

python acetylcholinesterase_analysis.py

## Review Results:

The script will calculate the average length and identify the longest sequence. Results will be printed to the console.

# Example Output

Number of sequences: 10
Average sequence length: 120.50
Length of the longest sequence: 150

# Data Sources

Acetylcholinesterase protein sequences were obtained from UniProt.

# Additional Resources
Acetylcholinesterase on UniProt
Acetylcholinesterase on NCBI
